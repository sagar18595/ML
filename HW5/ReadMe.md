Developed K-Means Algorithm from Scratch and Implemented on MNist Dataset

Discover Traffic Directions using vehicle tracklets
• Implemented a clustering method to discover the main traffic directions of vehicles observed by a traffic camera using clustering vehicle tracklets
• Clustering is done on tracklet file developed from tracking algorithm containing various features and list of detection containing bounding box.
• Detected the traffic direction by analyzing bounding box in subsequent frames.
• Improved Clustering Algorithm by Detecting Abnormal vehicle movement
