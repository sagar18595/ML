Detecting Human Hands using SVM :
• Designed a SVM classifier to detect human hands by using deep feature extractor Detectron2
• Trained the Data on positive training examples are image patches extracted at the annotated locations
• Implemented hard-negative mining Algorithm to find hardest negative example and iteratively train SVM on annoted images and deep features extractor detectron2 to detect human hand in images
